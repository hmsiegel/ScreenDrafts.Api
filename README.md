# Screen Drafts

Screen Drafts is a podcast where experts and enthusiasts competitively collaborate in the creation of screen-centric "Best of" lists. 

It was started by Clay Keller and Ryan Marker, formerly of the Vidiots Video Store Show podcast, who are also the show's "draft co-commissioners".

Screen Drafts is a serpentine-style draft where Guest G.M.s alternate placing picks on the single, definitive "Best Of" list for the episode's topic.

This project is an attempt to simplify the game by automating a number of the game play elements.
